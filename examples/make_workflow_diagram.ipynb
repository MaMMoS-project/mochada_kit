    "In `mochada_kit` bespoke themes for CHADA and MODA diagrams have been developed and are located in the directory `mochada_kit/themes`. To apply a theme to a plantuml diagram we need to add a line to the code above giving the name of the theme to be applied and the location of the folder where the themes reside. For example, to apply the theme `MOCHADA-CWA`, we  write:\n",

    "If you look in `mochada_kit/themes`, you will see that all the themes have this naming convention `puml-theme-*.puml`, where the * represents the name of the theme. In the line of code starting with `!theme` we only need the part of the theme name given by the * (without the starting `puml-theme-`and ending `.puml`). We then need to write `from` and give the location of the themes folder. If we want to store the plantuml code in `mochada_kit/gallery/puml_code` the relative location of the `mochada_kit/themes` folder is `../../themes`. If you want to store your puml code somewhere else, you may want to put the absolute path to the `mochada_kit/themes` folder. This can be easily obtained by importing `mochada_kit` and printing the \\_\\_THEMES_DIR\\_\\_ constant. Whatever operating system you are using, this is already formatted as a posix path (with forward slashes), which is required by plantuml:"
