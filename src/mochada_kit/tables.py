    Write a plantuml code file specifying a json diagram for each of
    five different cases:
        1. "contents" element --> Overview element.
           Filename: same as the json plus _overview.puml.
        2. "contents" element --> User Case element.

        5. "contents" element --> Data Processing element.
           Filename: same as the json plus _data_processing.puml.

    By default, the puml code files will be saved in the same
    directory as the json/yaml file specified by data_path. If
    the argument out_path is not None, the puml code files will be
    saved to the path specified by out_path.

    Highlights will be applied to all rows of the "contents" element and
    to the first ("title") row of each other element, according to the
    bespoke CHADA theme specified by theme_name.

    Specifying linked=True will add hyperlinks to the "contents" element.
    Once the puml code has been run against plantuml.jar resulting in
    svg image files, if these image files are all located in the same
    directory, you can easily navigate from one image to another by
    clicking the hyperlinks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    data_path : STR or pathlib.Path
        Absolute path or path relative to the current working directory
        pointing to a json or yaml file containing the CHADA data.
        If data_path points to a json file, the format of the file must be
        based on mochada_kit/templates/chada_tables_template.json.
        If data_path points to a yaml file, the format of the file must be
        based on mochada_kit/templates/chada_tables_template.yaml.
    out_path : STR, pathlib.Path or None, optional
        Specifies the folder where the plantuml code file will be
        saved. This allows the puml code and json/yaml file to be located
        in different folders, if desired. If None, the puml code is
        saved in the same folder as the data_path. If not None,
        if it is a relative path, it is assumed to be relative to
        data_path. An absolute path can also be supplied.
        The default is None.
    load_path : STR, pathlib.Path or None, optional
        If data_path points to a json file: if load_path = None,
        the json data will be directly written into the
        puml code rather than being loaded dynamically. If load_path
        is not None, load_path is the either the absolute path to the
        json file containing the data OR the relative path from
        out_path pointing to the data_path. In this case, the json
        data will be loaded dynamically and not written into the
        puml code.
        If data_path points to a yaml file: load_path has no
        effect, the data must always be written into the puml code.
        The default is None.
    out_name : STR or None, optional
        By default, the puml code output will have the same filename
        as the json input. To use a different filename for the output,
        please specify a string as out_name.
        The default is None.
    title : STR, LIST or None, optional
        Either a string or list of strings defining a title for
        the plot, or None, in which case, no title will be shown.
        If a list of strings is supplied, each item in the list will
        appear in a new row of the title. You can apply CREOLE syntax
        to the title strings e.g. to change the colour, make a table,
        make a link etc. All options are here:
            https://plantuml.com/creole
        The default is None.
    theme_name : STR, optional
        The name of one of the bespoke MOCHADA themes in the
        default folder given by __THEMES_DIR__. Only the part of the
        name after "MOCHADA-" is needed, i.e. to apply the theme
        'MOCHADA-plasma', theme_name='plasma'.
        The default is 'plasma'.
    linked : BOOL, optional
        If True, add hyperlinks to the "contents" element
        of all diagrams. Once the puml code has been run against plantuml.jar
        resulting in svg image files, if these image files are all located
        in the same directory, you can easily navigate from one image to
        another by clicking the hyperlinks (if they are opened in a browser).
        Links will not work with png output images. The also do not work
        if you insert an svg image into Microsoft Word or jupyter notebook.
        The default is True.
    scale : STR, INT or FLOAT, optional
        A parameter which helps to scale the diagram for png output. NOT
        necessary to use this with svg output as these can be scaled to
        any size later.
        Docs are here:

    """
    Handles paths for input and output, collects strings to be
    written at the top and bottom of the puml code, and supplies
    the data read from the json/yaml source file as a dict,
    if required.


    Parameters
    ----------
    data_path : STR or pathlib.Path
        Absolute path or path relative to the current working directory
        pointing to a json or yaml file containing the CHADA data.
        If data_path points to a json file, the format of the file must be
        based on mochada_kit/templates/chada_tables_template.json.
        If data_path points to a yaml file, the format of the file must be
        based on mochada_kit/templates/chada_tables_template.yaml.
    out_path : STR, pathlib.Path or None, optional
        Specifies the folder where the plantuml code file will be
        saved. This allows the puml code and json/yaml file to be located
        in different folders, if desired. If None, the puml code is
        saved in the same folder as the data_path. If not None,
        if it is a relative path, it is assumed to be relative to
        data_path. An absolute path can also be supplied.
        The default is None.
    load_path : STR, pathlib.Path or None, optional
        If data_path points to a json file: if load_path = None,
        the json data will be directly written into the
        puml code rather than being loaded dynamically. If load_path
        is not None, load_path is the either the absolute path to the
        json file containing the data OR the relative path from
        out_path pointing to the data_path. In this case, the json
        data will be loaded dynamically and not written into the
        puml code.
        If data_path points to a yaml file: load_path has no
        effect, the data must always be written into the puml code.
        The default is None.
    out_name : STR or None, optional
        By default, the puml code output will have the same filename
        as the json/yaml input. To use a different filename for the output,
        please specify a string as out_name.
        The default is None.
    title : STR, LIST or None, optional
        Either a string or list of strings defining a title for
        the plot, or None, in which case, no title will be shown.
        If a list of strings is supplied, each item in the list will
        appear in a new row of the title. You can apply CREOLE syntax
        to the title strings e.g. to change the colour, make a table,
        make a link etc. All options are here:
            https://plantuml.com/creole
        The default is None.
    theme_name : STR, optional
        The name of one of the bespoke MOCHADA themes in the
        default folder given by __THEMES_DIR__. Only the part of the
        name after "MOCHADA-" is needed, i.e. to apply the theme
        'MOCHADA-plasma', theme_name='plasma'.
        The default is 'plasma'.
    scale : STR, INT or FLOAT, optional
        A parameter which helps to scale the diagram for png output. NOT
        necessary to use this with svg output as these can be scaled to
        any size later.
        Docs are here:
            https://plantuml.com/commons#4252b72e6ebcd4d4
        Common values could be:
            1.5 (to set the aspect ratio),
            "1/3" (to set the aspect ratio)
            "1024 width" (to set the width to 1024 pixels)
            "100*200" (to set the output size to 100 by 200 pixels)
    return_out_base_only : BOOL, optional
        If True, return only out_base. This is useful if you just want
        to construct the full path to the puml code, e.g. if you want
        to run it and generate a diagram. If False, complete the function
        and return all returns.
        The default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    t_d : DICT or None
        Either the data for the tables read from file or None.
    out_base : pathlib.Path
        Path to the stem of the output puml code file i.e. everything
        except the file extension.
    top : LIST
        List of strings to be written at the top of the puml code.
    bottom : LIST
        List of strings to be written at the bottom of the puml code.
