We maintain a `Citation File Format (CFF) <https://citation-file-format.github.io/>`_ file: 
`CITATION.cff <https://github.com/MaMMoS-project/mochada_kit/blob/main/CITATION.cff>`_ in order to
give credit to contributors and to provide metadata for citing mochada_kit.

Under the ``Authors`` key, the main authors are listed by name, then 
the collective term ``The mochada_kit Contributors`` is listed, which includes all contributors to mochada_kit as shown in the 
`contributors graph of the repository <https://github.com/MaMMoS-project/mochada_kit/graphs/contributors>`_.

If you are one of ``The mochada_kit Contributors`` and would prefer to be additionally named as an author, in ``CITATION.cff`` please
open an `issue <https://github.com/MaMMoS-project/mochada_kit/issues>`_.
