This section contains detailed guides to using mochada_kit to create workflow diagrams, MODA/CHADA tables and json diagrams. 

.. tip::

   The example "Making a CHADA/MODA workflow diagram with plantuml and mochada_kit" is a great place to start.
   It provides a basic introduction to generating diagrams.

.. tip::

   To get an idea of what the output diagrams and tables look like, please have a look at 
   the .svg images in ``mochada_kit/gallery``. You can open .svg files in any browser. The plantuml (puml) code on which 
   they are based is available in ``mochada_kit/gallery/puml_code``.

.. tip::

   The jupyter notebooks on which the examples are based are provided in ``mochada_kit/docs/examples`` 
   and as Python scripts in ``mochada_kit/docs/examples/python_scripts``.
